This is a small hack built.

Use it well.

Some people keep their facebook profile pictures under privacy, this hack allows the users to get the complete images, (image loss in terms of pixel size is highly possible).

Run the code using
------------------------------------------------------
python FBViewer.py
------------------------------------------------------

or how-ever you've named your python in your environment variables under PATH.
If you don't understand the above line, this piece of code isn't for you.

Be careful.

Usage Rules
-------------------------------
After executing the program it asks for a URL input,
Go to the profile page of the person whose profile picture you want to view.
Right click on the profile picture and click on copy-link or copy-image-url.

Then paste it into the command shell.

On Windows :
	Right click on the top left corner icon and go to 'edit', then click 'paste'

On Linux and Mac , Ctrl+Shift+V or Command+V should do the magic.
